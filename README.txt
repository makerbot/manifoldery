Manifoldery is a simple STL manifold checker. It may also be used
to heal holes in non-manifold STL files.

There are most likely a large number of open source manifold
checkers out there; this one is mine.

There's no particular reason that Manifoldery can't be extended to
OBJ or similar files, or be used to decompose a triangle pile into 
a set of connected meshes, or could not be used to clean up near
points, or a thousand other completely random tasks. But let's not
get carried away.

This is what happens when I get stuck on a dozen-hour flight and
the airline is gracious enough to grant me a power jack; I hack
geometry.
